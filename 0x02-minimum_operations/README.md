# 0x02. Minimum Operations

## Overview
In this project, we aim to solve the problem of calculating the minimum number of operations required to achieve exactly n characters of 'H' in a text file using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations. 

## Concepts Needed
To tackle this problem effectively, understanding the following concepts will be instrumental:

- **Dynamic Programming**: Breaking down the problem into subproblems and building up the solution.
- **Prime Factorization**: Finding the sum of prime factors of the target number n.
- **Code Optimization**: Implementing an efficient solution from an optimization perspective.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Choosing the best option at each step to minimize operations.
- **Basic Python Programming**: Proficiency in Python, including loops, conditionals, and functions.

## Resources
To delve deeper into these concepts, refer to the following resources:
- [Dynamic Programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming/)
- [Prime Factorization](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/comp-number-theory/v/prime-factorization-1)
- [Code Optimization in Python](https://stackify.com/how-to-optimize-python-code/)
- [Greedy Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-algorithms/)
- [Python Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)

By leveraging these resources and concepts, you will be well-equipped to devise an efficient solution to the "Minimum Operations" problem.

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All files end with a new line
- The first line of all files is exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file at the root of the folder is mandatory
- Code documentation adhering to PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All files must be executable

## Tasks
### 0. Minimum Operations
- Write a method `minOperations(n)` that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to achieve exactly n characters of 'H' in the file.
- Return an integer representing the minimum number of operations.
- If n is impossible to achieve, return 0.

### Example
```python
n = 9
# Operations: H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste => HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH
# Number of operations: 6
```
